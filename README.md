# Email Knowledge Base

A topic-first knowledge base that ingests email from a Gmail/Google Workspace
mailing list and compiles it into an interlinked markdown wiki.

Raw emails are immutable evidence. Wiki pages are compiled knowledge.

Based on [Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f),
extended for email: thread awareness, supersession detection, and incremental
compilation.

## Current status

The repo already works for:

- backlog ingest from Gmail into `raw/`
- manual compile into `wiki/`
- local/read-only browsing via MkDocs
- coordinator-owned compile state in Postgres

The repo is **not** yet a polished team wiki. Live ingestion, strong search,
and chatbot-style querying are still future phases, and entity pages remain
noisy compared to topic pages.

## What this project is optimizing for

Near-term, this project should optimize for four things:

1. **Trustworthy topic pages**: project and system pages should preserve the
   concrete decisions, metrics, tables, and changes that matter.
2. **Provenance without clutter**: readers should be able to trust a page
   without scrolling through hundreds of lines of frontmatter.
3. **Topic-first navigation**: the wiki should feel browsable via hubs,
   rollups, glossary pages, and timelines, not just by scanning filenames.
4. **People pages as support structure**: entity pages should help navigation
   and attribution, not dominate the wiki or become the primary product.

## What it does

```
Gmail mailing list → ingest → raw/ (immutable emails) → compile → wiki/ (knowledge base)
```

1. **Ingests** emails from a Gmail mailing list (OAuth; backlog flow shipped,
   live flow designed but not yet shipped)
2. **Parses** each email into structured markdown with YAML frontmatter
3. **Compiles** raw emails into interlinked wiki pages using an LLM agent (Deep Agents + LiteLLM)
4. **Maintains** the wiki incrementally — new emails update only affected pages
5. **Detects** when newer emails supersede older guidance
6. **Lints** the wiki for contradictions, stale claims, and orphan pages

The result is a browsable folder of interlinked markdown files — your team's email
knowledge, compiled and cross-referenced. Open in VS Code, Obsidian, MkDocs, or any
markdown viewer.

## Why not just RAG?

> "Traditional RAG has the LLM rediscovering knowledge from scratch on every question.
> There's no accumulation." — [Karpathy](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f)

Classic RAG embeds email chunks and retrieves at query time. For ~100 emails/day over
months, this breaks down:
- **No synthesis**: 5 emails about the same topic produce 5 separate chunks, never combined
- **No supersession**: Old policy and new policy both rank equally in vector search
- **No accumulation**: Every question re-derives the same knowledge

This project **compiles** knowledge at ingest time. The wiki is the accumulated, cross-referenced,
supersession-aware state of everything the emails contain. Queries search pre-compiled
knowledge — not raw fragments.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- Gmail API credentials ([setup guide](#gmail-api-setup))
- LLM API access via LiteLLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, or any supported provider)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/indiamart-ai/email-knowledge-base.git
cd email-knowledge-base
uv sync
cp .env.example .env  # edit with your API keys
```

### Gmail API setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a project (or use existing)
3. Enable the Gmail API
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop application type)
5. Download as `credentials.json` to the project root
6. First run will open a browser for OAuth consent → saves `token.json`

### Usage

```bash
# 1. Pull last 30 days of mailing list emails into raw/
uv run python scripts/ingest_backlog.py --days 30

# 2. Compile all unprocessed raw emails into wiki pages
uv run python scripts/compile_all.py

# 3. Browse the result
ls wiki/topics/     # project/product pages
ls wiki/entities/   # people and team pages
ls wiki/policies/   # current policies with history
cat wiki/index.md   # master catalog

# 4. Lint the wiki for issues
uv run python scripts/lint_wiki.py
```

## Architecture

```
Gmail mailing list
  -> ingest (`scripts/ingest_backlog.py`, `src/ingest/*`)
  -> immutable raw emails in `raw/`
  -> Postgres queue/catalog (`src/db/*`)
  -> compiler agent (`src/compile/compiler.py` + `prompts.py`)
  -> wiki pages in `wiki/`
  -> MkDocs viewer (`mkdocs.yml`, `mkdocs_hooks.py`)
```

### Runtime responsibilities

- `raw/` is immutable source material. The agent never edits it.
- Postgres owns compile state and run bookkeeping.
- The compiler agent writes wiki content only.
- The coordinator script verifies outcomes, stamps modified pages,
  appends to `wiki/log.md`, and rebuilds `wiki/index.md`.

### Current information architecture

- `wiki/topics/` is the most important surface. This is where project and
  decision knowledge should concentrate.
- `wiki/systems/` is for products, services, tools, URLs, and mailing lists.
- `wiki/entities/` is for humans only.
- `wiki/policies/`, `wiki/timelines/`, and `wiki/conflicts/` exist, but are
  still underused compared to topics and systems.
- Query APIs and chatbot-style retrieval are not shipped yet.

## Delivery plan

### Phase 0 — working pipeline ✅

Done today:

- backlog ingest from Gmail
- raw email serialization
- compile queue in Postgres
- wiki compiler + coordinator guardrails
- MkDocs viewer
- validator, lint, snapshots, audits

### Phase 1 — trustworthy and approachable wiki

Current priority:

- move provenance out of bloated markdown frontmatter and into the catalog/render layer
- make the wiki topic-first and easier to browse
- de-noise entity pages so they support the wiki instead of overwhelming it
- add better hubs, glossary, rollups, and visible freshness/status metadata
- keep docs, backlog, and milestones honest about what is actually shipped

### Phase 2 — live ingestion

After the wiki is trustworthy enough to deserve automation:

- Gmail watch + Pub/Sub
- webhook endpoint
- `historyId` tracking
- quiet-period thread compilation
- default attachment/image handling

### Phase 3 — queryable knowledge base

- local search that works at wiki scale
- better navigation across related topics and timelines
- question-answering over compiled knowledge with citations

### Phase 4 — team-scale system

- multi-user/team workflow
- stronger review/eval loops
- production-grade deployment and multi-mailing-list support

## What makes it better as a wiki

If the output should feel like a real wiki rather than a file dump, the next
improvements are mostly structural:

- **Topic-first homepages and hubs**: readers should land on projects, systems,
  and cross-cutting themes before they land on people pages.
- **Rollups over filenames**: generate pages like "all WhatsApp work" or
  "all buyer-chat work" so browsing does not require guessing slugs.
- **Glossary and metadata**: define acronyms, show freshness/status/owner-like
  context, and make page state legible at a glance.
- **Less provenance noise**: preserve trust, but render sources in a way that
  supports the prose instead of swallowing it.
- **Cleaner category boundaries**: entities are humans, systems are products and
  tools, timelines/policies/conflicts appear when they add navigational value.

The detailed target structure is captured in
[`docs/issues/09-internal-wiki-structure.md`](docs/issues/09-internal-wiki-structure.md).
The execution plan for getting there lives in
[`docs/issues/10-phase1-implementation-plan.md`](docs/issues/10-phase1-implementation-plan.md).

## Deploying to GCP

The wiki is served read-only on Cloud Run behind Identity-Aware Proxy, accessible
to the Workspace org. See `docs/gcp-migration.md` for the full phased plan.

One-time setup (Owner/Editor on the target GCP project required, OAuth consent
screen must already be configured Internal):

```bash
make bootstrap        # creates GCS bucket w/ versioning, enables APIs
```

Publish the current local `wiki/` to the deployed viewer:

```bash
make publish          # mkdocs build → rsync to GCS → redeploy Cloud Run
```

Defaults target project `voice-eval-stack-im`, region `asia-south1`, bucket
`indiamart-email-kb`, service `email-kb-viewer`, and IAP domain `indiamart.com`.
Override via env vars (`GCP_PROJECT`, `GCP_REGION`, `GCP_BUCKET`, `GCP_SERVICE`,
`GCP_IAP_DOMAIN`) passed to the scripts in `scripts/gcp/`.
