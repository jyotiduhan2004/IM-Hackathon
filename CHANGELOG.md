## [Unreleased] — 2026-04-13

### Added
- Per-source role annotation on rendered entity pages (From ✍️ / To 📬 /
  CC 📋 / body 💬) in `mkdocs_hooks.py::_render_raw_source`.
- 15-minute per-batch timeout wrapper in `scripts/compile_overnight.sh`.
- Five-persona blind-audit framework (newbie, PM, information-architecture,
  fact-check, journalist) producing independent reports + synthesis under
  `docs/reviews/`.
- Architectural plan for separating wiki prose from email provenance
  (SQLite catalog) — see GitHub issue #8.
- Research notes: deepagents library patterns, edit-tool behavior,
  inline-citation proposal, Anthropic engineering reading list, QMD
  (Tobi Lütke) as a local semantic search layer.
- `docs/incidents/` directory holding postmortems (carved out of CHANGELOG).

### Changed
- CHANGELOG restructured to Keep-a-Changelog format. Historical
  postmortems moved to `docs/incidents/2026-04-13-phase0-bootstrap.md`.

### Fixed
- Overnight compile zombies: cleaned up `compile_all` processes that
  survived the shell's `Killed: 9` after gtimeout didn't propagate
  through `uv run`.
- Removed unused `yaml` import in `scripts/backfill_stubs.py`.
- `scripts/snapshot_wiki.py::reset-raw-compiled` replaced a broken
  `content.split("---", 2)` frontmatter parse with
  `src/utils.py::extract_frontmatter`. The old parser mangled any raw
  file whose subject or body contained a literal `---` (e.g.
  `Informational---Transforming SonarQube`). Codex flagged this in
  `docs/reviews/codex-priority-review-20260413T090000Z.md`.
